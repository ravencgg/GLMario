Console/Rendering:
    Multi color text on a per letter basis 
        -> should the "start" variable be taken out of the StringTextColor struct?
           it is implied if there is always a StringTextColor object during drawing
           which there will be because if one is not supplied, then a default one is used.

     Remove console from the debug profiling
     Remove the Flush from the draw console 
        
Optimization:
    Cull draws out of viewport

    Broad phase collision detection


To figure out:

    New project structure
        Unity build, with platform_win32.cpp included behind header guards.

    Should there be "Scene" types? 
        -> cutsene, game, menu
        -> each could have their own memory and entities, multiple could be active at a time
