Console/Rendering:
    Multi color text on a per letter basis 
        -> should the "start" variable be taken out of the StringTextColor struct?
           it is implied if there is always a StringTextColor object during drawing
           which there will be because if one is not supplied, then a default one is used.
        
Optimization:
    Cull draws out of viewport

    Broad phase collision detection
