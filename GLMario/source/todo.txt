TOREDO:
    Renderer
        -> convert to individual render groups? draw to framebuffers?
        -> file static stuff? probably not

Console/Rendering:
    Multi color text on a per letter basis 
        -> should the "start" variable be taken out of the StringTextColor struct?
           it is implied if there is always a StringTextColor object during drawing
           which there will be because if one is not supplied, then a default one is used.
     

     World space text rendering 

     Remove console from the debug profiling
     Remove the Flush from the draw console 
        
Optimization:
    Cull draws out of viewport

    Broad phase collision detection
    
    Split the entity array into groups for faster searching

    Make a DebugMemoryArena for console string / debug graph memory storage
        -> convert all the debug calls to macros so they can be compiled out of non-profiling builds


To figure out:

    New project structure
        Unity build, with platform_win32.cpp included behind header guards.

    Should there be "Scene" types? 
        -> cutsene, game, menu
        -> each could have their own memory and entities, multiple could be active at a time

    Global Unique IDs? or keep ids unique within their own system only?
